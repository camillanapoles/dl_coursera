1
00:00:09,235 --> 00:00:12,673
In his book, the Functional Art,
Alberto Cairo provides a tool for

2
00:00:12,673 --> 00:00:16,537
thinking about design tradeoffs when
building information graphics, and

3
00:00:16,537 --> 00:00:18,849
he calls this tool
the Visualization Wheel.

4
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,110
In this conceptualization there
are two poles of a circle.

5
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:27,560
The top one represents highly complex
data which informs at a deep level.

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,790
While the bottom provides easier access to
data but only informs in a shallow manner.

7
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:37,960
Inside the circle are dimensions which
describe tradeoffs between two approaches.

8
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,630
While Cairo provides a number
of interesting dimensions.

9
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,767
It's important to note
that this is a tool for

10
00:00:42,767 --> 00:00:45,400
designers to think about
their visualizations.

11
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,070
And not so much an analytics tool itself.

12
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,870
Your needs from any particular
problem might change which of

13
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,790
these dimensions are important or

14
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:56,575
might introduce new dimensions
which you should be thinking about.

15
00:00:56,575 --> 00:01:00,760
Cairo actually suggests a role in an
organization or a professional background

16
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,410
might also influence the kinds
of graphics we want to make.

17
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,799
So I'd like to ask you as someone
who's studying data science,

18
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:10,893
who are you trying to reach
through your visualizations?

19
00:01:14,139 --> 00:01:18,800
Let's dig in and look at a few of
the trade offs that Cairo considers.

20
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,710
The first is abstraction and figuration.

21
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:25,320
A highly figurative visual describes
the phenomenon using physical

22
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,830
representations of the phenomena,
such as photographs or drawings.

23
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:32,230
As the representations
become less real and

24
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:36,570
more conceptual, the emphasis shifts
from figuration to abstraction.

25
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:42,660
The second dimension he discusses is,
is functionality and decoration.

26
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,710
A completely functional graphic
has no embellishments and

27
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:48,980
is closer to a direct
representation of the data.

28
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,600
While a heavily decorated graphic
has more artistic embellishments.

29
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,550
As it is with all of these dimensions,
there isn't a clear better or worse.

30
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,150
Embellishments may increase
the amount of time a viewer

31
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,240
spends considering the visual.

32
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,900
Exploring it's nuances and

33
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:08,680
forming mental associations which may
increase familiarity and memorability.

34
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:11,990
The third dimension is density and

35
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:16,050
lightness as they relate to the amount
of information being shown.

36
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:19,910
There are lots of great examples
of this in scientific visuals,

37
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,910
where some figures are intended
to be studied in depth,

38
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,580
while others are meant to
quickly augment a narrative.

39
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,930
You can see this dimension at play
when comparing magazine infographics,

40
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,960
where the reader is likely to be
more heavily engaged in the content.

41
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,610
Two advertisements in the same magazine
where readers are likely to only

42
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:39,680
quickly consider an ad.

43
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:44,120
Here's an example from my field of study
which was published by Harvard and

44
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,230
MIT describing the patterns
of access of users

45
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:50,060
in the edX massive open
online course platform.

46
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,320
Take a moment to study this image.

47
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,590
What sense can you make of this image?

48
00:03:04,246 --> 00:03:06,977
If we consider Cairo's third dimension.

49
00:03:06,977 --> 00:03:11,780
It'd be tough not to say that
this is a fairly dense graphic.

50
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,460
The main portion of the graphic,
a scatterplot,

51
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:19,000
has two axes which are labeled, as do
each of the two subplots to the left and

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,200
the bottom, which are histograms.

53
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:21,930
The axis for

54
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:26,940
the histograms can be a bit confusing as
they bleed into the scatterplot axis, but

55
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,218
change the unit of measure and
the direction of the measurement.

56
00:03:31,218 --> 00:03:34,601
For instance, in the X axis at
the top of the scatter plot,

57
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:38,607
percentage of chapters access is
being used as the unit of measure and

58
00:03:38,607 --> 00:03:42,354
increases as you move towards
the right hand side of the figure.

59
00:03:42,354 --> 00:03:46,425
You have the same X axis for the histogram
to the left of the graph is in

60
00:03:46,425 --> 00:03:52,060
thousands of persons and increases as
you move to the left side of the figure.

61
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,560
There's some red lines
overlayed on the graphic.

62
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,110
Breaking the scatter plot roughly into
quadrants, but with minimal labeling it's

63
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:02,670
a little unclear what
the quadrants end up representing.

64
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,690
Regardless of whether
this is a good figure or

65
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,270
not, it would certainly be considered
an example of a dense figure.

66
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:13,730
The fourth aspect Cairo maps is
the dimensionality of the graphic.

67
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:18,410
A multidimensional graphic describes
a phenomena as a whole and

68
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:22,880
invites the viewer to explore many
different aspects of the phenomena.

69
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,182
A unidimensional graphic
instead focuses on a single or

70
00:04:27,182 --> 00:04:30,940
a few items and
explores them in one or more ways.

71
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,601
The fifth dimension is originality and
familiarity.

72
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:38,792
In the modern world, we're used to
seeing a plethora of different kinds of

73
00:04:38,792 --> 00:04:42,463
information graphics,
things like bar charts and line charts.

74
00:04:42,463 --> 00:04:45,796
And thinking in terms of these
representations is taught at a very

75
00:04:45,796 --> 00:04:47,010
young age.

76
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,140
For instance, my daughter,
who's almost five,

77
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:52,720
came home from preschool the other day
with a page that showed a bar chart.

78
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,900
That she and others had made in class.

79
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,550
To celebrate learning about the American
election, the whole class got together and

80
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,060
had a vote on what they would have for

81
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,690
snack, chocolate ice cream or
mint chocolate chip ice cream.

82
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:08,410
Of course, mint chocolate chip ice
cream won, as one might expect.

83
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:12,343
But, my point here, is that, these
are basic ways of thinking about data in

84
00:05:12,343 --> 00:05:15,489
a graphical form and
they are now being taught very early on.

85
00:05:15,489 --> 00:05:18,154
And this makes them familiar
to a broad population.

86
00:05:19,395 --> 00:05:21,085
This wasn't always so though.

87
00:05:21,085 --> 00:05:25,515
It's safe to say that the bar chart
is fairly familiar to most people but

88
00:05:25,515 --> 00:05:27,555
a graphic with more originalities,

89
00:05:27,555 --> 00:05:31,585
elements that need to be explained or
studied by the user.

90
00:05:31,585 --> 00:05:35,183
Here's a very famous
graphic by Charles Minard.

91
00:05:35,183 --> 00:05:39,770
It describes Napoleon's
march into Russia in 1812.

92
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:42,130
Take a moment to study the graphic.

93
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:46,010
Broadly speaking, there are five different
kinds of information being visualize in

94
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,100
this graphic.

95
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,190
How many of those five pieces do you see?

96
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,692
Here's what I see.

97
00:05:54,692 --> 00:05:57,340
First there are elements of
geography showing us the various

98
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,640
rivers in towns along the way.

99
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:04,241
The width of the tan upper bar represents
the size of Napoleon's army, and

100
00:06:04,241 --> 00:06:09,135
you can see it shrinks from the beginning
of the campaign from 422,000 to

101
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:12,365
only 100,000 once the French reach Moscow.

102
00:06:12,365 --> 00:06:16,421
The lower black bar shows Napoleon's
retreat from Russia, and there are various

103
00:06:16,421 --> 00:06:20,850
points along it which are mapped to
dates and temperatures in Celsius.

104
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:24,730
We see the bar thins dramatically
as the army shrinks in size.

105
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:31,405
So the five kinds of data in Minard's
visualization include location,

106
00:06:31,405 --> 00:06:34,848
direction, temperature,
army size and dates.

107
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:40,911
The last dimension which Cairo shares is
the novelty and redundancy dimension.

108
00:06:40,911 --> 00:06:45,115
Redundancy is the tendency of a graphic
to tell the same story in many

109
00:06:45,115 --> 00:06:46,232
different ways.

110
00:06:46,232 --> 00:06:50,870
For instance, you might use the height of
bars on a bar chart with an axis as well

111
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,203
as color to emphasize the largest bar.

112
00:06:53,203 --> 00:06:56,407
This one's a bit tricky,
you don't want to bore your readers or

113
00:06:56,407 --> 00:06:58,289
make your graphics overly complex.

114
00:06:58,289 --> 00:07:02,478
But you do want to encode information in a
way which supports their understanding of

115
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:04,960
the phenomena you've described.

116
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,007
On this dimension,

117
00:07:06,007 --> 00:07:10,084
novelty is the act of describing each
phenomena in the graphic in only one way.

118
00:07:11,818 --> 00:07:14,780
There are no rights and
wrongs in the visualization wheel.

119
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,170
The purpose of the wheel is
to help you understand and

120
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,610
compare the visual
approaches you might take.

121
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:25,580
As a reflective activity, Cairo suggested
you can plot your thinking, a long each of

122
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,720
these dimensions and then join those
points together, to create a radar plot.

123
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,980
Here Cairo provides two examples of
the visualization wheel in action.

124
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:39,330
On the left hand side you see there is
more emphasis towards complex visuals.

125
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:43,750
Those which are dense, multidimensional
and have high functionality.

126
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,730
On the right,
you see the visualization wheel.

127
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:50,900
There are more elements of decoration,
lightness, and figuration.

128
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,000
Cairo suggests that the left
wheel is more indicative of work

129
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,860
being done by scientists and engineers,
while the right wheel is more

130
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:02,170
indicative of work being done by artists,
graphic designers, and journalists.

131
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,350
This tension between how scientists and
engineers might view the visualization of

132
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:11,330
data, and how artists and
journalists might, is an interesting one.

133
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:14,210
And we'll revisit it at
the end of next week.

134
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:17,550
In the next lecture, we'll go a bit
deeper, and consider some heuristics from

135
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:20,249
Edward Tufte,
as to what makes a good visualization.

136
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:25,820
The visualization wheel is one tool which
we have in order to better compare two

137
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,920
different ways of visualizing information.

138
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,810
In the next lecture,
we'll dig in a bit and

139
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:34,690
see how you might use the visualization
wheel to evaluate your own graphics.
