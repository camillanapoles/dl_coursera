00:00:08,834 --> 00:00:13,053
Edward Tufte is a seminal figure on how
to design visual displays of quantitative

2
00:00:13,053 --> 00:00:13,869
information.

3
00:00:13,869 --> 00:00:17,327
In fact, this is the title of
my favorite book of his, and

4
00:00:17,327 --> 00:00:21,030
I highly encourage you
to check out his work.

5
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,920
In this book, he introduces two
interesting graphical heuristics,

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,910
the data-ink ratio and chart junk.

7
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,090
First, what's a heuristic?

8
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:34,390
A heuristic is a process or rule that is
meant to guide you in decision making.

9
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:40,120
Is by definition not known to be optimal
or perfect, but to be practical in nature.

10
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,050
Heuristics are meant to be followed until
you've a reason to deviate from them.

11
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,933
Tufte's first graphical
heuristic is data-ink ratio.

12
00:00:46,933 --> 00:00:52,350
Tufte defines data-ink as
the non-erasable core of a graphic.

13
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:58,550
The non-redundant ink arranged in response
to variation in the numbers represented.

14
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:03,210
In other words, the data-ink is essential
to the sense-making process for

15
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,130
a given variable.

16
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,330
Tufte defines the data-ink
ratio as the amount of data-ink

17
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,060
divided by the total ink
required to print the graphic.

18
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,610
Now I don't think that he's actually
suggesting we measure the amount of ink

19
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:20,530
laid down on the page, but
instead is suggesting that we remove those

20
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,500
elements which don't add new
information to the graphic.

21
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,764
Perhaps one of the best known examples
showing data-ink reduction was done by

22
00:01:28,764 --> 00:01:31,964
Darkhorse Analytics,
an information, visualization, and

23
00:01:31,964 --> 00:01:35,440
design company in Edmonton,
Alberta, Canada.

24
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,890
They've put together four examples of
how the data-ink ratio can be approved.

25
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:43,230
And I'm going to link to those
in the next reading assignment.

26
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,390
But I'm going to walk through
the first one of those here.

27
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:50,040
We start with the table of
the data about food items and

28
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,550
the number of calories in those items.

29
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:55,660
The first step is to remove
unwanted background imagery

30
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:58,990
since it provides no value
to understanding the chart.

31
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:02,558
We also remove the gray background
behind the bars since it provides no

32
00:02:02,558 --> 00:02:03,588
conceptual value.

33
00:02:03,588 --> 00:02:07,210
Then we get rid of
the redundancy throughout.

34
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,820
This includes getting rid of the legend,

35
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,965
since each bar is labeled
directly along the x-axis.

36
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,860
The title in the y-axis labels are
trimmed, since there's plenty of reference

37
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,770
throughout the image to this being
about calories for food items.

38
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,290
This leaves us with a much smaller image.

39
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:28,130
There are some heavy lines forming
borders which add no value, so

40
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,280
we can remove them too.

41
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,581
Color is a tricky item to
include in charts and graphs.

42
00:02:33,581 --> 00:02:37,950
We won't be going into depth on
color theory in this course.

43
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,130
But color is a challenge when trying
to engage with persons who might

44
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,260
be color vision deficient or color blind.

45
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,090
There are some tactics to work around.

46
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:51,660
For instance, it used to be best practice
to replace coloration with patterns,

47
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,560
sometimes called hatching in graphics.

48
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,080
This brings its own challenges,
which we'll see in a bit.

49
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:01,920
Instead, the solution is almost always
to remove all color, except for

50
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,740
one which you can use as emphasis and
link to that color in your text.

51
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,290
Someone then viewing a chart out of
context would still get the sense

52
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,510
of emphasis without being
overwhelmed by a rainbow of data.

53
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,300
So let's drop colors except for bacon,

54
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,971
with the presumption that this text
is clearly referenced in the data.

55
00:03:21,905 --> 00:03:23,170
Three-dimensional bars and

56
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,680
drop shadows can go as well,
since these don't add extra value.

57
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,569
We could also drop the bolding throughout.

58
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,675
There's still a lot of gridwork
left in this image and

59
00:03:32,675 --> 00:03:36,552
it's a bit unclear what the value of this
gridwork is, so we're going to drop it.

60
00:03:36,552 --> 00:03:41,760
Now grids can be valuable, but
they're often just a distraction.

61
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,760
For the moment though, study the image.

62
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,117
What's the difference in the number
of calories between bacon,

63
00:03:47,117 --> 00:03:50,546
our data point of interest, and
say, potato chips or chili dogs?

64
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:55,469
Just removing the lines doesn't
make it easier to read.

65
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:59,160
But the values of the data
are pretty simple here.

66
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,110
So let's directly label
each bar in the graphic.

67
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,070
Now, how big is the difference
between bacon and

68
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,190
potato chips or bacon and chili dogs?

69
00:04:09,402 --> 00:04:13,039
Certainly, you have to do a bit of math,
but you can still get a quick estimate by

70
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:16,865
glancing at the graphic, and an exact
value through comparing numbers directly.

71
00:04:16,865 --> 00:04:19,660
And there you have it.

72
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,660
By increasing the data-ink ratio, we have
made the graphic not only simpler and

73
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,290
more readable, but increased the amount
of information the viewer sees.

74
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,490
I encourage you to check out the other
examples from Darkhorse Analytics

75
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,170
linked in the next reading.

76
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,390
As they've done this clean up for

77
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:38,640
a variety of different
visuals including maps.

78
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,650
We'll continue our exploration of Tufte's
heuristics by looking at chart junk

79
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:43,500
in the next lecture.
