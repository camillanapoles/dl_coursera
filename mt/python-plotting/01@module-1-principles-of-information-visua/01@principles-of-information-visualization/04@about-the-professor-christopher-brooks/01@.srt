00:00:05,529 --> 00:00:10,410
I'm Chris Brooks, I'm a research assistant
professor at the School of Information.

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,400
I'm director of learning analytics and

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,430
research at the office
of academic innovation.

5
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:18,600
I'm a computer scientist who studies
e-learning, student achievements,

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,540
student success, both at higher and
online in situations like in MOOCs.

7
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,620
One thing I remember as a child
my father was a physicist and so

8
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,590
I would go to the university as many
kids do and my kids do now, come and

9
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,180
experience the university and
what it has to offer.

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,750
And as a physicist he had
access to some of the first

11
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,410
instances of the worldwide web.

12
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:39,480
And so I got to sit there and

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,660
play with things like NCSA Mosaic Early
versions of Netscape, etc.

14
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,540
and I think it's that connectivity,

15
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:50,670
the idea that information was now a first
class citizen in the world of sciences.

16
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,540
And so this new world that we're
starting to see with data science,

17
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,330
these are competencies that
learners are learning in preschool.

18
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:01,450
That are starting to think about data as a
different way of investigating the world.

19
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:06,520
And I think that for me that started
in a very early stage when I was young

20
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,290
at the university seeing
what my father was doing and

21
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,300
being able to play with computers.

22
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,517
I'm happy to try and bring that
to as many people as possible and

23
00:01:14,517 --> 00:01:18,719
that's really one of the goals of this
Introduction to Data Science with Python.
