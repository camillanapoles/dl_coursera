1
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,230
This module's assignment is
meant to be unique to you and

2
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,430
will allow you to show off your work
in a portfolio should you want to.

3
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:19,390
You can make the assignment
challenging and insightful and try and

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,390
solve a real world problem.

5
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,192
Or you can make it into
a surface level and

6
00:00:23,192 --> 00:00:26,670
demonstrate the techniques that
you've learned in this course.

7
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,600
The choice is up to you.

8
00:00:28,758 --> 00:00:30,350
When you login to the assignment for

9
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:33,930
Jupiter notebook,
you'll be given a customized question.

10
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,830
This question will give you a region
in the world, as well as a topic.

11
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,257
We try and generate the region at a city
level, but you're welcome to use data

12
00:00:41,257 --> 00:00:44,860
at the state or provincial level, as well,
or at a countrywide level, as well.

13
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,660
As long as it could encompass
the region that you're actually given.

14
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,540
The topic will be chosen from a list of
things that I am interested in seeing,

15
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:57,340
sports and athletics, or political events,
or weather and environmental topics.

16
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,210
And we might add more topics over time.

17
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,210
After this, you'll be asked to find at
least two datasets available on the Web

18
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:06,429
and use them to answer
a question of your choosing.

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,830
Now, my motivation for
this assignment is pretty simple.

20
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,007
I want to learn more about the world and

21
00:01:13,007 --> 00:01:17,162
I want you to help teach me through
good information visualizations.

22
00:01:17,162 --> 00:01:21,387
I want you to start to apply your skills
to real world data and gain experience

23
00:01:21,387 --> 00:01:25,944
starting with an ill-defined problem and
moving through the data collection and

24
00:01:25,944 --> 00:01:29,470
cleaning in pandas,
to data representation in that you live.

25
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:32,970
Finally, I would love to share some of
the great looking visualizations from this

26
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,170
course with others.

27
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,810
If you do not mind we sharing
your solutions, just indicate so

28
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,490
when you upload to the peer review system.

29
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,150
I am looking forward to
seeing what you built.
